### Installing
The installation process of A1 Robot Arm includes securing the arm to the mounting base to ensure its stability and operating accuracy. The design of the mounting holes allows the arm to be securely mounted on a variety of platforms, providing flexible mounting options.

Please select the appropriate installation platform and fixing method according to the operating environment and usage requirements of the arm to ensure its stability and safety during operation.

If you need assistance installing the robot arm on a base, please refer to the A1 installation video.

### Powering Up
Before we begin, confirm that all of the packing material has been removed from the robot, and the area around the robot is free and clear from any furniture or obstacles.

To power up, please use the cable provided with the device and plug it into the charging port where the rated voltage is 48V. 

### Shutting Down
In the event of an emergency where the normal shutdown procedure cannot be followed, disconnect the power cable from the power supply to immediately halt the robot arm's operation.

### Emergency Stop
The power supply unit of the robot arm includes an emergency stop switch (E-stop) for immediate power interruption during emergencies. Pressing the E-stop button will instantly disconnect power to the robot arm, ensuring operator safety and preventing damage to the equipment.
