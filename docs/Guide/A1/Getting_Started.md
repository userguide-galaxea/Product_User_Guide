### Installing

The installation process of Galaxea A1 includes securing the arm to the mounting base to ensure its stability and operating accuracy. The design of the mounting holes allows the arm to be securely mounted on a variety of platforms, providing flexible mounting options.

Please select the appropriate installation platform and fixing method according to the operating environment and usage requirements of the arm to ensure its stability and safety during operation.

### Powering On

Before you begin, make sure all packing materials have been removed from the robot and that the area around the robot is free of furniture and obstacles.

To power up Galaxea A1, use the provided power adapter and cable, and plug the power cable into the charging port, ensuring the voltage is 48V.

### Powering Off

Once the robotic arm and control system have completely stopped, you can just unplug the power cable to turn off Galaxea A1.

In the current version of Galaxea A1, the motor does not have a brake, so cutting off the power may cause the robotic arm to drop suddenly. We will continue to improve the product to address this issue.

#### Emergency Stop

The power supply unit of the robot arm includes an Emergency Stop switch (E-Stop) for immediate power interruption during emergencies. Pressing the E-stop button will instantly disconnect power to the robot arm, ensuring operator safety and preventing damage to the equipment.
