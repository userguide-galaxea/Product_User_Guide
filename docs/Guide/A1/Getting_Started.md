### Installing
The installation process of Galaxea A1 includes securing the arm to the mounting base to ensure its stability and operating accuracy. The design of the mounting holes allows the arm to be securely mounted on a variety of platforms, providing flexible mounting options.

Please select the appropriate installation platform and fixing method according to the operating environment and usage requirements of the arm to ensure its stability and safety during operation.

### Powering Up
To power up, with the provided power adapter and cable, plug one end of the power adapter cable into the power port on the base of the robot arm, and connect the other end to the power source, ensuring the voltage is 48V.

### Powering Off
Once the robot arm and control system have completely stopped, you can just unplug the power cable to turn off Galaxea A1.

In the current version of Galaxea A1, the motor does not have a brake, so cutting off the power may cause the robotic arm to drop suddenly. We will continue to improve the product to address this issue.

### Emergency Stop
The power supply unit of the robot arm includes an emergency stop switch (E-stop) for immediate power interruption during emergencies. 

Pressing the E-stop button will instantly disconnect power to the robot arm, ensuring operator safety and preventing damage to the equipment.
